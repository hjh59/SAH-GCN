# SAH-GCN
## 🚀 Introduction
This repository provides the source code for our paper.  
We propose a **heuristic personality recognition framework** that:  
- Fuses multiple conversations to capture more abundant interaction signals.  
- Incorporates utterance-level affection to model fine-grained affective cues.  
- Achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the CPED dataset. Please download it from the official repository:

🔗 https://github.com/scutcyr/CPED

After downloading, place the dataset in the following structure:
```bash
datasets/
  ├── CPED/    # place dataset here
```

## ⚙️ Pretrained Model
Our method relies on pretrained language models (e.g., BERT).
You can download them directly from Hugging Face:

🔗 https://huggingface.co/models

After downloading, place the model in the following structure:
```bash
pretrained_model/
  ├── BERT/    # place model here
```
