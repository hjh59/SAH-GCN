## 🚀 Introduction

This repository provides the source code for our paper.  
We propose a **heuristic personality recognition framework** that:  
- Fuses **multiple conversations** to capture long-term interaction signals.  
- Incorporates **utterance-level affection** to model fine-grained affective cues.  
- Achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the CPED dataset. Please download it from the official repository:
🔗 https://github.com/scutcyr/CPED
After downloading, place the dataset in the following structure:

```arduino
datasets/
  ├── CPED/    # place dataset here
```

## Pretrained Model
Our method relies on pretrained language models (e.g., BERT).
You can download them directly from Hugging Face:
🔗 https://huggingface.co/models
After downloading, place the mdoel in the following structure:


```arduino
models/
  ├── BERT/    # place model here
```


```bash
git clone https://github.com/hjh59/SAH-GCN.git
